How does it work?

- Type /wcp to open the main window. When you are in a group or raid with a Warlock, you will see them auto-populate in the window. When more locks join the group, they will also appear in the window.
- Assign a Curse and/or Banish icon! You can either select one or the other or both or neither!
- Updates in the /wcp window update in real time across all users with the addon.
- If you close the summary window, type /wcpsummary to open it back up.
- The Notify button sends all Warlock Curse and Banish assignments into chat, depending on which type of group or raid you are in.
- The clear button wipes all existing Curse and Banish assignments.
- All warlocks do NOT need the addon for someone to make assignments. A single Warlock can make assignments and notify the rest in chat however, if you do not have the addon installed you will not have the small summary window.

Warlocks that are not assigned should not appear in the list.


Patch V1.0.1:
- Added wcpsummary window with notify options:
